HashiHelp is a cross-platform wellness application designed to empower individuals with Hashimoto's Disease. The app focuses on tracking symptoms and environmental triggers to identify health patterns and generate data-driven reports for medical consultations.

## 📍 Project Status: Conception & Research
This project is currently in the **Initial Design & Discovery Phase**. As a student in a Software Development program, I am currently leveraging UX/UI principles to define user personas and map out the application's architecture before moving into frontend development.

## 🚀 The Vision
- **Symptom Tracking:** A low-cognitive-load interface for logging daily health data.
- **Trigger Analysis:** Identifying correlations between diet, stress, sleep, and flares.
- **Doctor-Ready Reports:** Generating simplified PDF summaries to maximize time during medical appointments.
- **Cross-Platform Accessibility:** Future-proofed for Web, iOS, and Android.
